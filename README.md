# TravelTrackerFrontEnd
React front end for Travel Tracker Capstone App using Google Maps API


# Description 
This application(webpage) is being created for travelers alike. This app will allow users to track their travels and keep track of important information such as date of travel, as well location. A popular habit of world travelers is to buy a map of the world, hang it on the wall, and add pins to every city
and country they have travaled to. This app will allow them to do that virtually, while also allowing making it shareable for friends and family to see. 


# Tech Stack 
We use Google sign in to authenticate, create, and protect user profiles. We use Google Maps API and Geocode API, as well as a Postgres database to track the travel locations of of a user, and render the pins on a Google map. We use JavaScript, and the JavaScript React library to create the components and pages for our front end. Python and Postgresql were used to create the endpoints for our database. Heroku was used for back end and front end deployment.
